# ak-cross-m-review domain language

- **fixed target** — a clean committed `REPO_ROOT`, resolved `BASE_SHA`, recorded
  `PRE_HEAD`, and one materialized full diff reused by every reviewer, then
  resealed against HEAD and status before the terminal verdict.
- **skill root** — the physical directory containing the loaded `SKILL.md`.
  Prompts and adapters resolve from here.
- **leg root** — one independent writable clone detached at `PRE_HEAD`, unique
  to a panel member. It has its own Git config, refs, and objects, and no remote.
  Its transport runs here; reviewers never receive `REPO_ROOT`.
- **authority set** — the ordered owner decisions, ADR/spec/issue clauses, and
  repository contracts frozen before dispatch. Changed code is evidence, not
  authority for itself.
- **lens** — one question asked of the fixed target. Correctness uses
  `prompts/cmr-reviewer.md`; completeness uses
  `prompts/cmr-completeness.md`.
- **correctness** — Trace–Break–Prove a reachable counterexample in behavior
  that exists.
- **completeness** — Clause–Wire–Exercise each authoritative requirement and
  find delivery that is missing, contradicted, partial, or hollow.
- **preset** — a named wrapper that selects one lens and returns the root
  engine result unchanged. It has no review procedure of its own.
- **panel token** — one supported transport selected by `CMR_PANEL`: `codex`,
  `grok`, optional host-Agent `claude`, formal optional `gemini`/`agy`, or
  optional `opencode`. The `claude` preset explicitly requests host-Agent Opus
  4.8 and never inherits the host default or Fable routing; if unavailable, it
  degrades until the caller explicitly selects another panel transport/model.
- **agy second pool** — after one `AGY_MODEL` call, and only on confirmed
  quota/429, the same panel member may call `AGY_FALLBACK_MODEL` once. Empty
  disables it; auth and other failures do not retry.
- **actual family** — the vendor family of the model that really produced a
  review. It is transport evidence, never a caller-supplied label. OpenCode
  GLM is Z.AI; an OpenAI model through OpenCode is the same family as Codex.
- **degraded member** — a selected transport that failed or returned no review.
  It remains visible and never counts as approval.
- **candidate** — one reviewer's evidence-backed claim containing location,
  claim, failure scenario, authority, evidence, and severity hint; remedy is
  optional.
- **judge** — the main session that verifies the union of candidates against
  the fixed target and authority, separately adjudicating defect and remedy.
- **lawful rejection** — `unconstitutional`, `over_defense`,
  `not_established`, or `scope_creep`, always with evidence.
- **terminal verdict** — completeness returns `complete|gaps`; correctness
  returns `converged|findings`; either may return `escalate|hard-stop`.
- **review only** — CMR reports and stops. The caller owns edits, commits,
  retries, and later gates. Reviewers may write evidence inside `LEG_ROOT`, but
  never repair, commit, push, or mutate remote state. Dirty, moved, or
  remote-changed legs and any unexpected target mutation are preserved without
  reset or cleanup.
- **deletion outranks addition** — for equivalent behavior, remove or simplify
  before adding another mechanism.
