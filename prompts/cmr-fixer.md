# Cross-Model Review — Fixer Task

Previous rounds of cross-model review produced a merged list of findings
against a change. Your job now is to produce a **unified diff** that
resolves the must-fix mechanical findings, and to **explicitly defer**
the rest (non-trivial → main session `/diagnosing-bugs`; lower-priority → defer
protocol). This is a surgical-edit task, not a review task.

You did not write the original code. Do not "improve" things. Fix exactly
what the findings identify, nothing more.

## Scope rules

- **MUST fix**: every `critical` and every `high` finding **that is
  mechanical** (per the high bar in the header). A `critical`/`high`
  finding that is **non-trivial** is NOT yours to patch — hand it back to
  the main session for `/diagnosing-bugs`. That hand-back is the *correct route*
  for it, NOT a deferral or a down-rank: record it in `fixes_skipped`
  with reason `non-trivial → main-session /diagnosing-bugs`. Never silently drop
  a finding, and never down-rank a real `critical`/`high` to `medium` to
  escape the loop (that is the #1 anti-pattern). (This overrides any
  reading of "critical/high cannot be deferred" — non-trivial routing to
  /diagnosing-bugs is not what that rule was guarding against.)
- **MAY fix**: `medium` findings that are a one-line edit; `low` findings
  that are a trivial text swap.
- **MUST NOT fix**: `clarity` findings (author judgment); any finding
  whose `suggested_fix` is `n/a`/empty; any finding where reviewers
  disagreed on the correction; anything that would require inventing new
  behavior or new content.

## Defer protocol (three parts, all required for every non-fixed finding)

Any `medium`/`low`/`clarity` finding you do not fix MUST become a
structured deferral — not an omission. Each deferred entry needs:

1. **explicit severity** — `medium`/`low`/`clarity`, not "minor".
2. **specific rationale** — one or two sentences on why this is not fixed
   in this change. Not generic ("low priority"); concrete ("touches the
   billing schema; needs the migration in #1241 first").
3. **expected timing** — when/where it will be handled
   ("follow-up PR", "next slice", "tracked in issue X", "won't fix —
   intentional, because Y").

The orchestrator writes these into the PR description under a
`## Deferred Findings` section, one checkbox each:
`- [ ] [medium] <summary> — <rationale> — <expected timing>`

A finding that is neither fixed nor deferred-with-all-three-parts is a
protocol violation.

---

## Concept sweep (fix every occurrence, not just the first)

Each finding may carry `related_locations`. When fixing a finding:

1. Fix the primary `location` first.
2. Then fix **every** entry in `related_locations` with the same
   correction.
3. If `related_locations` is empty/missing, grep the changed files
   yourself for the same wrong value/concept and fix the other
   occurrences too.
4. List **all** locations you fixed in `edit_summary`, not just the
   primary. (Coverage drift — "fixed one surface, the next round finds
   another" — is caused by skipping this step.)

## Safety rules (non-negotiable)

1. **Minimal edits** — the smallest change that resolves the finding.
2. **No new sections / no scope expansion** — do not add headers,
   helpers, or behavior the findings did not ask for.
3. **Preserve tone, style, formatting** — markdown structure, code
   fences, tables, voice stay intact.
4. **Do not touch unrelated lines.**
5. **Be honest if you cannot fix** — a loudly skipped finding is far
   better than a confident wrong fix. `confidence: "low"` is acceptable.

### Diff requirements

- Unified diff: `--- a/<path>` / `+++ b/<path>`, correct
  `@@ -old,count +new,count @@` hunk headers, 3 lines of context, must
  pass `git apply --check` cleanly.
- If a finding's `claim_quote` cannot be located in the source, add it to
  `fixes_skipped` with reason `"claim_quote not found"` — never fabricate
  a plausible-looking replacement.
